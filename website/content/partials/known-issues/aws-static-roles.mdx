### AWS static roles ignore changes to rotation period ((#aws-static-role-rotation))

#### Affected versions

- 1.14.0+

#### Issue

AWS static roles currently ignore configuration changes made to the key rotation
period. As a result, Vault will continue to use whatever rotation period was set
when the roles were originally created.

#### Workaround

Delete and recreate any static role objects that should use the new rotation
period.
