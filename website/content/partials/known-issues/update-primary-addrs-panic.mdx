### Using 'update_primary_addrs' on a demoted cluster causes Vault to panic ((#update-primary-addrs-panic))

#### Affected versions

- 1.13.3, 1.13.4 & 1.14.0

#### Issue

If the [`update_primary_addrs`](/vault/api-docs/system/replication/replication-performance#update_primary_addrs)
parameter is used on a recently demoted cluster, Vault will panic due to no longer 
having information about the primary cluster.

#### Workaround

Instead of using `update_primary_addrs` on the recently demoted cluster, instead provide an 
[activation token](/vault/api-docs/system/replication/replication-performance#token-1).
