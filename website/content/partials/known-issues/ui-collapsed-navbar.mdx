### Collapsed navbar does not allow you to click inside the console or namespace picker

#### Affected versions

The UI issue affects Vault versions 1.14.0+ and 1.15.0+.
A fix is expected for Vault 1.16.0.

#### Issue

The Vauil UI currently uses a version of HDS that does not allow users to click
within collapsed elements. In particular, the dev console or namespace picker
become inaccessible when viewing the components in smaller viewports.

#### Workaround

Expand the width of the screen until you deactivate the collapsed view. Once the full navbar is displayed, click the desired components.
