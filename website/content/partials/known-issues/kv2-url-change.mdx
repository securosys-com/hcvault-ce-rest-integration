### URL change for KV v2 secrets engine ((#kv2-url-change))

#### Affected versions

1.15.0+

#### Issue

Recent improvements to the Vault UI updated the URL structure of the KV v2 secrets engine that affect existing URLs.

Previously, URLs for KV v2 used the pattern:
`ui/vault/secrets/hma/show/${secretPath}`. With the recent refactor, KV v2 URLs
now use the following pattern:
`ui/vault/secrets/hma/kv/${encodedUriComponent(secretPath)}/details`.

Opening older URLs now result in 404 errors.

#### Workaround

Currently, no workaround exists.

Improvements that include automatic redirects for older URLs are planned for
1.15.4.
