### Rotation configuration persistence issue could lose transform tokenization key versions

A rotation performed manually or via automatic time based rotation after
restarting or leader change of Vault, where configuration of rotation was
changed since the initial configuration of the tokenization transform can
result in the loss of intermediate key versions.  Tokenized values from
these versions would not be decodeable.  It is recommended that customers
who have enabled automatic rotation disable it, and other customers avoid
key rotation until the upcoming fix.

#### Affected versions

This issue affects Vault Enterprise with ADP versions 1.10.x and higher.  A
fix will be released in Vault 1.11.9, 1.12.5, and 1.13.1.
