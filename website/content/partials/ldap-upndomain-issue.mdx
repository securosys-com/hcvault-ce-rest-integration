## LDAP auth engine and upndomain

Users of the LDAP auth engine with the `upndomain` configuration setting populated
should hold off on upgrading to 1.4.x for now. We are investigating a regression
introduced by [#8333](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/8333). There is
no Github issue for this bug yet.
