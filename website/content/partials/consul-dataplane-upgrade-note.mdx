### Consul dataplane compatibility
If you are using Consul on Kubernetes, please be aware that upgrading to Consul 1.14.0 will impact Consul [secrets](/vault/docs/secrets/consul), [storage](/vault/docs/configuration/storage/consul), and [service registration](/vault/docs/configuration/service-registration/consul). As of Consul 1.14.0, Consul on Kubernetes uses [Consul Dataplane](/consul/docs/connect/dataplane) by default instead of client agents. Vault does not currently support Consul Dataplane. Please follow the Consul 1.14.0 [upgrade guide](/consul/docs/k8s/upgrade#upgrading-to-consul-dataplane) to ensure that your Consul on Kubernetes deployment continues to use client agents.
