## Okta auth with > 200 groups

In 1.4.0 Vault started using the official Okta Go client library. Unlike
the previous Okta library it used, the official library doesn't automatically
handle pagination when there are more than 200 groups listed. If a user
associated with more than 200 Okta groups logs in, only 200 of them will be
seen by Vault. The fix is [#9580](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/9580)
and will eventually appear in 1.4.x and 1.5.x point releases.
