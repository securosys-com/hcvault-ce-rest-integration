~> **Note**: The Active Directory (AD) secrets engine has been deprecated as of the Vault
1.13 release. We will continue to support the AD secrets engine in maintenance mode for
six major Vault releases. Maintenance mode means that we will fix bugs and security issues
but will not add new features. For additional information, see the [deprecation table](/vault/docs/deprecation)
and [migration guide](/vault/docs/secrets/ad/migration-guide).
