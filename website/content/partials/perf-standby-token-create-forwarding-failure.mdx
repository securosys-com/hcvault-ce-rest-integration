### Token creation with a new entity alias could silently fail

A regression caused token creation requests under specific circumstances to be
forwarded from perf standbys (Enterprise only) to the active node incorrectly.
They would appear to succeed, however no lease was created. The token would then
be revoked on first use causing a 403 error.

This only happened when all of the following conditions were met:
 - the token is being created against a role
 - the request specifies an entity alias which has never been used before with
   the same role (for example for a brand new role or a unique alias)
 - the request happens to be made to a perf standby rather than the active node

Retrying token creation after the affected token is rejected would work since
the entity alias has already been created.

#### Affected versions

Affects Vault 1.13.0 to 1.13.3. Fixed in 1.13.4.
