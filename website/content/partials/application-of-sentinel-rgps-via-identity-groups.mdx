As of versions `1.15.0`, `1.14.4`, and `1.13.8`, [the Sentinel RGPSs derived from membership in identity groups apply
only to entities in the same and child namespaces, relative to the identity group](/vault/docs/enterprise/sentinel#rgps-and-namespaces).

Also, the [`group_policy_application_mode`](/vault/api-docs/system/config-group-policy-application) only applies to
to ACL policies. Vault Sentinel Role Governing Policies (RGPs) are not affected by group policy application mode.
