## The AWS STS region selection

The AWS Client used in Vault was updated for improved STS performance in
1.3.2 and 1.4.0 [#8161](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/8161),
however this introduced a side effect of limiting the regions being selected for validation
and a greater possibility of encountering an "invalid security token" error.

Users of the AWS auth engine should upgrade to 1.4.1 release instead,
where this side effect was fixed in [#8679](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/8679).
