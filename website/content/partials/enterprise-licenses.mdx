### Enterprise licenses

In versions 1.2.6, 1.3.9, 1.4.5, and 1.5.2, the enterprise licenses were not incorporated correctly
into the build and we have issued patch releases (x.y.z.1) for enterprise customers containing the
proper license. As the previous builds were both not working and causing confusion, we have removed
the binaries.
