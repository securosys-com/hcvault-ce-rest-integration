### Cluster initialization hangs with `retry_join`

The
[`retry_join`](/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage/index#retry_join-configuration)
feature no longer successfully attempts to rejoin the raft cluster every 2
seconds following a join failure.

The error occurs when attempting to initialize non-leader nodes with a
[`retry_join` stanza](/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft/#retry_join-stanza). This
affects multi-node raft clusters on [impacted versions](#impacted-versions).

The bug was introduced by commit
https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/commit/cc6409222ce246ed72d067debe6ffeb8f62f9dad
and first reported in https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/16486.

#### Impacted versions

Affects versions 1.11.1, 1.11.2, 1.10.5, and 1.10.6.  Versions prior to these
are unaffected.

NOTE: This error does not extend to version 1.9.8+, which is slightly different
in this portion of the code and does not exhibit the same behavior.

New releases addressing this bug are coming soon.
