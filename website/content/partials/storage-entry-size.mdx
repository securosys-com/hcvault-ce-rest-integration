The maximum size of an object written to a storage backend is determined
by that backend.

The default entry size limit for the integrated storage backend, is 1 MiB. You
can configure the allowable entry size with the `max_entry_size` parameter in
your the [storage stanza](/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft#max_entry_size).
Vault automatically chunks any storage entry that is larger than 512 KiB but
smaller than `max_entry_size` into smaller pieces before writing the entry to Raft.

For Vault deployments using the Consul storage backend, the default entry size
limit is 512 KiB. The default size is enforced by Consul rather than Vault. You
can configure the entry size limit with the 
[`kv_max_value_size`](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#kv_max_value_size)
Consul parameter.

However, Consul **does not** chunk storage entries the way Vault does. Consul
stores the entry as a single, large write. Even small changes may result in
large read-modify-write cycles for storage entries, which can degrade Vault
performance. Larger writes may also destabilize your Consul cluster by delaying
heartbeats, which can lead to cluster leadership instability.
