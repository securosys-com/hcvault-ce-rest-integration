## AWS instance metadata timeout

In 1.4.0 Vault started using an updated AWS Go SDK which had support for v2 of
the [EC2 instance metadata service][aws-ec2-imdsv2]. However, due to the way the
SDK was configured in Vault, there can be a delay of around 2 minutes when Vault
relies on the instance metadata service for credentials. A fix that reduces the
delay went into 1.5.5: [#10133](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/10133).
