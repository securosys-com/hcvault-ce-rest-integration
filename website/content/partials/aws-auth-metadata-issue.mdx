## The AWS auth engine

Users of the AWS Auth Engine should be cautious with this upgrade, because in
1.3.2 we began adding metadata to tokens issued with this method. While the
metadata does help with tying tokens to a particular person or machine, it
also can also take a performance toll.

Whether there's a performance toll depends on if and how you've configured the
`auth/aws/config/identity` endpoint. To determine if you could be effected:

- Read your identity configuration: `$ vault read auth/aws/config/identity`
- Determine what Vault is using for identity (`role_id` if unconfigured)
- Determine what role type(s) you're using (`iam` and/or `ec2`)
- Consider the rate of change of the metadata fields for each role type

Metadata fields for `iam` roles:

- `client_arn`
- `canonical_arn`
- `client_user_id`
- `auth_type`
- `inferred_entity_type`
- `inferred_entity_id`
- `inferred_aws_region`
- `account_id`

Metadata fields for `ec2` roles:

- `instance_id`
- `region`
- `account_id`
- `ami_id`

For example, if you use `role_id` for identity and only `iam` roles, and
_many_ machines use the same role, you would conclude that the `client_arn`
for the machines logging in would have a high rate of change, and so you'd
see a new storage write each time a new machine logged in under that role.

If you use `role_id` for identity and only `iam` roles, and
and only _one_ long-lived machine used the role, you would conclude that the
`client_arn` for the machines logging in would have a low rate of change.
Unless you added the optional "role-session" to its ARN, in which case you
could still have a higher rate of change.

However, if you had configured identity to use an `iam_alias` of the `full_arn`,
or an `ec2_alias` of `instance_id`, you would be likely to see a lower rate of
change for all fields.

For users seeing a performance issue, we recommend implementing one of the
aliases above, or waiting until a patch is released providing greater
flexibility around whether to use this functionality.
