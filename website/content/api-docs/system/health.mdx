# `/sys/health`

@include 'alerts/restricted-root.mdx'

The `/sys/health` endpoint is used to check the health status of Vault.

## Read health information

This endpoint returns the health status of Vault. This matches the semantics of
a Consul HTTP health check and provides a simple way to monitor the health of a
Vault instance.

| Method | Path          |
| :----- | :------------ |
| `HEAD` | `/sys/health` |
| `GET`  | `/sys/health` |

The default status codes are:

- `200` if initialized, unsealed, and active
- `429` if unsealed and standby
- `472` if disaster recovery secondary (both active and standby nodes within the DR secondary)
- `473` if performance standby
- `501` if not initialized
- `503` if sealed

<Note>
In rare occasions such as during cluster instability, a node may return 429 even when it was part of a DR secondary (472) or a perf-standby (473). When configuring a Load Balancer based on health status API, it's important to recognize that a 429 indicates a standby node that doesn't process the request itself, read or write.
</Note>

### Parameters

- `standbyok` `(bool: false)` – Specifies if being a standby should still return
  the active status code instead of the standby status code. This is useful when
  Vault is behind a non-configurable load balancer that just wants a 200-level
  response. This will not apply if the node is a performance standby.

- `perfstandbyok` `(bool: false)` – Specifies if being a performance standby should
  still return the active status code instead of the performance standby status code.
  This is useful when Vault is behind a non-configurable load balancer that just wants
  a 200-level response.

- `activecode` `(int: 200)` – Specifies the status code that should be returned
  for an active node.

- `standbycode` `(int: 429)` – Specifies the status code that should be returned
  for a standby node.

- `drsecondarycode` `(int: 472)` – Specifies the status code that should be
  returned for a DR secondary node.

- `performancestandbycode` `(int: 473)` – Specifies the status code that should be
  returned for a performance standby node.

- `sealedcode` `(int: 503)` – Specifies the status code that should be returned
  for a sealed node.

- `uninitcode` `(int: 501)` – Specifies the status code that should be returned
  for a uninitialized node.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/health
```

### Sample response

This response is only returned for a `GET` request.

Note: `replication_performance_mode` and `replication_dr_mode` reflect the state of
the active node in the cluster; if you are querying it for a standby that has
just come up, it can take a small time for the active node to inform the
standby of its status.

```json
{
  "initialized": true,
  "sealed": false,
  "standby": false,
  "performance_standby": false,
  "replication_performance_mode": "disabled",
  "replication_dr_mode": "disabled",
  "server_time_utc": 1516639589,

}
```
