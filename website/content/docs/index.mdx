# Documentation

Welcome to the Vault documentation! This documentation is more of a reference guide for all available features and options of Vault. If you're just getting started with Vault, please start with the [introduction](/vault/docs/what-is-vault) instead, and work your way up to the [Getting Started](/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install) guide.
