# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.3.5 compared to 1.3.4. Please read it carefully.

## AWS auth metadata

The metadata handling for AWS Auth logins has changed:

The default set of metadata fields has been changed to `account_id` and `auth_type`. If your
application relies on fields that were removed, they may be added back via the AWS Auth identity
configuration endpoint (see example below).

## Known issues

The AWS metadata changes have caused an issue preventing renewal of tokens issued via AWS Auth.
This has been fixed in Vault 1.3.6. The issue may be addressed in Vault 1.3.5 by configuring the
required metadata explicitly:

```
vault write auth/aws/config/identity \
  ec2_metadata=account_id,auth_type,instance_id,region \
  iam_metadata=account_id,auth_type,client_user_id,canonical_arn,inferred_entity_id,inferred_aws_region
```
