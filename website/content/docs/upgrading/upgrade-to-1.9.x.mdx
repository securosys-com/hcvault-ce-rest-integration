# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.9.x compared to 1.8. Please read it carefully.

## OIDC provider

Vault 1.9.0 introduced the ability for Vault to be an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity
provider. To support the feature, Vault's [default policy](/vault/docs/concepts/policies#default-policy)
was modified to include an ACL rule for its Authorization Endpoint. Due to the handling
of Vault's default policy during upgrades, existing deployments of Vault that are upgraded
to 1.9.0 will not have this required ACL rule.

If you're upgrading to 1.9.0 and want to use the new OIDC provider feature, the following
ACL rule must be added to the default policy **or** a policy associated with the Vault
[Auth Method](/vault/docs/auth) used to authenticate end-users during
the OIDC flow.

```hcl
# Allow a token to make requests to the authorization endpoint for OIDC providers.
path "identity/oidc/provider/+/authorize" {
  capabilities = ["read", "update"]
}
```

## Identity tokens

The Identity secrets engine has changed the procedure for creating Identity
token roles. When creating a role, the key parameter is required and the key
must exist. Previously, it was possible to create a role and assign it a named
key that did not yet exist despite the documentation stating otherwise.

All calls to [create or update a role](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/tokens#create-or-update-a-role)
must be checked to ensure that roles are not being created or updated with
non-existent keys.

## SSH role parameter `allowed_extensions` behavior change

Prior versions of Vault allowed clients to specify any extension when requesting
SSH certificate [signing requests](/vault/api-docs/secret/ssh#sign-ssh-key)
if their role had an `allowed_extensions` set to `""` or was missing.

Now, Vault will reject a client request that specifies extensions if the role
parameter `allowed_extensions` is empty or missing from the role they are
associated with.

To re-enable the old behavior, update the roles with a value
of `"*"` to the `allowed_extensions` parameter allowing any/all extensions to be
specified by clients.

## Deprecations

### HTTP request counter deprecation

In Vault 1.9, the internal HTTP Request count
[API](/vault/api-docs/v1.8.x/system/internal-counters#http-requests)
will be removed from the product. Calls to the endpoint will result in a 404
error with a message stating that `functionality on this path has been removed`.

Vault does not make backwards compatible guarantees on internal APIs (those
prefaced with `sys/internal`). They are subject to change and may disappear
without notice.

### Etcd v2

Support for Etcd v2 will be removed from Vault in Vault 1.10 (not this Vault
release, but the next one). The Etcd v2 API
was deprecated with the release of [Etcd
v3.5](https://etcd.io/blog/2021/announcing-etcd-3.5/), and will be
decommissioned in the Etcd v3.6 release.

Users upgrading to Vault 1.9 and planning to eventually upgrade to Vault 1.10
should prepare to [migrate](/vault/docs/commands/operator/migrate) Vault storage to
an Etcd v3 cluster prior to upgrading to Vault 1.10. All storage migrations
should have [backups](/vault/docs/concepts/storage#backing-up-vault-s-persisted-data)
taken prior to migration.

## TLS cipher suites changes

In Vault 1.9, due to changes in Go 1.17, the `tls_prefer_server_cipher_suites`
TCP configuration parameter has been deprecated and its value will be ignored.

Additionally, Go has begun doing automated cipher suite ordering and no longer
respects the order of suites given in `tls_cipher_suites`.

See [this blog post](https://go.dev/blog/tls-cipher-suites) for more information.

### Identity token backend key rotations

Existing Vault installations that use the [Identity Token
backend](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/tokens) and have [named
keys](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/tokens#create-a-named-key) generated will
encounter a panic when any of those existing keys pass their
`rotation_period`. This issue affects Vault 1.9.0, and is fixed in Vault 1.9.1.
Users should upgrade directly to 1.9.1 or above in order to avoid this panic.

If a panic is encountered after an upgrade to Vault 1.9.0, the named key will be
corrupted on storage and become unusable. In this case, the key will need to be
deleted and re-created. A fix to fully mitigate this panic will be addressed on
Vault 1.9.3.

### Activity log Non-Entity tokens

When upgrading Vault from 1.8 (or earlier) to 1.9 (or later), client counts of [non-entity tokens](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count#non-entity-tokens) will only include the tokens used after the upgrade.

Starting in Vault 1.9, the activity log records and de-duplicates non-entity tokens by using the namespace and token's policies to generate a unique identifier. Because Vault did not create identifiers for these tokens before 1.9, the activity log cannot know whether this token has been seen pre-1.9. To prevent inaccurate and inflated counts, the activity log will ignore any counts of non-entity tokens that were created before the upgrade and only the non-entity tokens from versions 1.9 and later will be counted.

Before upgrading, you should [query Vault usage metrics](/vault/tutorials/monitoring/usage-metrics#querying-usage-metrics) and report the usage data for billing purposes.

See the client count [overview](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count) and [FAQ](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count/faq) for more information.
