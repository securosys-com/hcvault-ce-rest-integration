```release-note:change
secrets/pki: A new aliased api path (/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/sign-self-issued)
providing the same functionality as the existing API(/pki/root/sign-self-issued)
does not require sudo capabilities but the latter still requires it in an
effort to maintain backwards compatibility.
