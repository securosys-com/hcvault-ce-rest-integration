```release-note:change
agent: Errors in the template engine will no longer cause agent to exit unless
explicitly defined to do so. A new configuration parameter,
`exit_on_retry_failure`, within the new top-level stanza, `template_config`, can
be set to `true` in order to cause agent to exit. Note that for agent to exit if
`template.error_on_missing_key` is set to `true`, `exit_on_retry_failure` must
be also set to `true`. Otherwise, the template engine will log an error but then
restart its internal runner.
```
