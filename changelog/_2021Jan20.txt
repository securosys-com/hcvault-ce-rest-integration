```release-note:security
Mount Path Disclosure: Vault previously returned different HTTP status codes for
existent and non-existent mount paths. This behavior would allow unauthenticated
brute force attacks to reveal which paths had valid mounts. This issue affects
Vault and Vault Enterprise and is fixed in 1.6.2 (CVE-2020-25594).
```
```release-note:security
