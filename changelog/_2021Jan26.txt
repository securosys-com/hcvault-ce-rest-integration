```release-note:security
Limited Unauthenticated Remove Peer: As of Vault 1.6, the remove-peer command
on DR secondaries did not require authentication. This issue impacts the
stability of HA architecture, as a bad actor could remove all standby
nodes from a DR
secondary. This issue affects Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 and 1.6.1, and is fixed in
1.6.2 (CVE-2021-3282).
