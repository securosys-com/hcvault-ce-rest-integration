```release-note:bug
auth/ldap: The logic for setting the entity alias when `username_as_alias` is set
has been fixed. The previous behavior would make a request to the LDAP server to
get `user_attr` before discarding it and using the username instead. This would
make it impossible for a user to connect if this attribute was missing or had
multiple values, even though it would not be used anyway. This has been fixed
and the username is now used without making superfluous LDAP searches.
